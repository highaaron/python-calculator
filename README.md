# 🧮 Python CLI Calculator

Welcome to my first Python project! This is a simple, text-based calculator built with Python that can perform basic arithmetic operations — with error handling, rounding, and a clean loop to keep the calculations going until you're done.

## 💡 Why I Made This
I’m 14 and just diving into programming — this project helped me learn:
- How to take user input
- How to handle errors like dividing by zero
- How to loop a program until the user quits
- Basic Git and GitHub workflow!

I’m slowly working my way up to bigger projects — this is my starting point.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulo
- 🔁 Loop for repeated calculations
- 🧠 Smart error handling (like division by zero)
- 🔢 Rounds results to 2 decimal places
- ❌ Handles invalid inputs with try/except

## 🧪 How to Run

Make sure Python is installed on your system (you can check with `python --version` in terminal).

Then run this in your terminal:

```bash
python calculator.py
